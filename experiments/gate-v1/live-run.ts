/**
 * Live per-version driver for the gate matrix (issue #62).
 *
 * Brings up one seeded test-bed version, drives a real browser through the
 * compiled program, and tears everything down. The measurement rules are the
 * whole point, so they are stated once here and enforced below:
 *
 * 1. **A failed step is the measurement, not an error to recover from.** Nothing
 *    in this file retries a step, downgrades an outcome, or catches an assertion
 *    failure. `ReplayRunner` owns the only permitted second attempt (repair,
 *    bounded by `maxRepairsPerRun`), and its `StepOutcome` is emitted verbatim.
 *
 * 2. **A skip is not a failure.** A version whose container never started, whose
 *    image would not pull, or whose seed state does not match the base version
 *    produced no measurement at all. Recording that as a failed run would invent
 *    a data point; dropping it would shrink the denominator silently. Skips go
 *    to the ledger with a reason and never reach the NDJSON.
 *
 * 3. **Teardown is unconditional.** Every bring-up is paired with a `finally`,
 *    so a crash mid-version cannot leave a container holding port 3000 and make
 *    the *next* version fail for a reason that has nothing to do with churn.

 * ADR-0003 pins that needs `--runs 6` (48 runs); `--runs 5` is 40 and lands two
 * runs short, so the arithmetic in #66's suggestion of 5 does not quite clear
 * its own floor.
 *
 * The default is nevertheless **3**, and the gap is reported rather than hidden:
 *
 * - 3 is enough to *see* flakiness. Any disagreement between repeats of one
 *   unchanged version is the harness's, and one run per version cannot show it
 *   at all. That is the question blocking every later number.
 * - 6 × 8 versions is 48 container boots. A default nobody runs teaches nothing,
 *   and the floor is a property of the *published measurement*, not of the loop
 *   you run while developing.
 * - `section9SampleFloor()` puts the shortfall in the report, so a 24-run matrix
 *   can never be mistaken for a §9 measurement. Clearing the floor is an
 *   explicit `--runs 6`, stated in the run that claims it.
