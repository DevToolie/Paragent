/**
 * The delegated repair client (#189) — a fake host callback, no network, no key.
 *
 * What these guard, in order of how much it would cost to get wrong:
 *
 * 1. **Every proposal is flagged unmeasured.** A delegated repair reports zero
 *    tokens because nobody counted them, not because none were spent. If one
 *    exit path forgot the flag, those zeros would enter `mean(cost_repair)` and
 *    push the §9 kill-line ratio toward a false pass.
 * 2. **The host only ever sees the authorized payload.** Delegation adds a
 *    third party; `RepairContext` carries `params`.
 * 3. **A non-answer is an answer.** Decline, throw, timeout, and garbage all
 *    land on `corrected_action: null` — never a retry, never a hang.
 * 4. **A proposal touching the assertion is dropped whole**, exactly as the
 *    model client's is.
