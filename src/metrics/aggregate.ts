 * ## What counts as a hit
 *
 * Defined in [ADR-0014](../../docs/decisions/ADR-0014-cache-read-path.md), and
 * it is a **conjunction of two independently stored facts**:
 *
 * ```
 * cache hit  ≡  program_source == "cache"  AND  replay_valid
 * ```
 *
 * Replay is deterministic and uses no model — the model only appears in repair
 * — so a hit cannot mean "skipped a model call during replay". It means *this
 * run did not need fresh reasoning to obtain a program*. That is provenance;
 * whether the program then worked is `replay_valid`, which already exists and
 * is deliberately **not** redefined here. #67 is explicit that hit-rate must not
 * be squeezed into an existing field.
 *
 * **A repaired step is a miss**, even though it passed: it cost model tokens,
 * which is the thing this metric exists to track. `REPAIRED_PASS` therefore
 * lands in the denominator and not the numerator, via `replay_valid === false`.
 *
 * ## Why the denominator excludes file-loaded steps
 *
 * A step whose program came from `--program <bundle>` has no cache provenance at
 * all, and `program_source` is simply absent on it. Counting those as misses
 * would make hit-rate a function of **how the operator invoked the runner**
 * rather than of the cache: a matrix run against a file bundle would report 0%,
 * which reads as "the cache is failing" when the truth is "the cache was never
 * asked". So they are excluded entirely and an all-file run reports `no_data`.
 *
 * No target and no threshold. §9 gives a direction ("up") and no number, and
 * inventing one here would be exactly the category-B failure
 * `docs/INTEGRITY-AUDIT.md` exists for.
