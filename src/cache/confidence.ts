/**
 * Confidence, self-invalidation, and the repair rewrite (PRD §5.3, issue #64).
 *
 * `contracts/cache-row.schema.json` has carried `confidence`, `success_count`,
 * `failure_count` and `last_verified_at` since B5. Nothing ever updated them:
 * the compiler wrote zeros and `ReplayRunner` never touched the cache. §5.3
 * makes those fields the mechanism rather than bookkeeping —
 *
 * > Entries are confidence-weighted by recent success rate; stale entries
 * > self-invalidate on assertion failure; the repair rewrites the entry
 *
 * — so until this module they described a self-healing cache that did not exist.
 *
 * ## The two rules that matter more than the maths
 *
 * 1. **Confidence never gates the gate measurement.** Nothing here is consulted
 *    to decide whether to attempt a step. A matrix run attempts every compiled
 *    step regardless of confidence, because skipping a low-confidence row would
 *    quietly shrink the step-validity denominator and inflate the headline
 *    number. During Track 1 confidence is *recorded*, not *acted on*. This is
 *    exactly the optimisation a later reader will helpfully add, so it is said
 *    here, in `docs/gate/cache.md`, and pinned by
 *    `tests/unit/cache-confidence.test.ts`.
 *
 * 2. **Every update goes through `writeCacheRow()`.** A repaired action can
 *    carry a locator the original never had, so a rewrite is exactly as capable
 *    of leaking tenant material as a first write. The privacy boundary is not
 *    re-implemented here; the update path builds a candidate and hands it to the
 *    same gatekeeper, and `tests/canary/repair-rewrite.test.ts` proves a tainted
 *    repair is still refused.
 *
 * ## The numbers are chosen defaults, not measurements
 *
 * `CONFIDENCE_ALPHA` and `INVALIDATION_THRESHOLD` are **design choices**. No
 * measurement supports them and none is claimed — `docs/INTEGRITY-AUDIT.md`
 * category B exists because of exactly this failure mode. What justifies them is
 * the behaviour they produce, which is stated and tested rather than asserted:
 *
 * | Situation | Result |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | Fresh row, first PASS | `1.0` — one observation, and it succeeded |
 * | Fully-confident row, two consecutive failures | `0.49` → **invalidated** |
 * | …then one PASS | `0.643` — recovers above the threshold |
 * | Fresh row, first-ever failure | `0.0` → **invalidated** immediately |
 * | Passed 100×, then 3 failures today | `0.343` → **invalidated** |
 *
 * That last row is §5.3's own example: "a row that passed 100 times last year
 * and failed 3 times today is stale". A plain success *rate* would score it
 * 0.97 and call it healthy, which is why the weighting is exponential and not
 * an average.
 */

/**
 * Strip the fields that describe *the write that produced a version*, before
 * handing a row back to the write path to produce the next one.
 *
 * `pool_eligible` / `pool_ineligible_reason` are **outputs** of a write, not
 * inputs to the next one. Forwarding the stored value would turn a
 * recomputation into a demand: `writeCacheRow()` throws when a caller asserts
 * `pool_eligible: true` and the row no longer earns it, so a repair that
 * produced a less-poolable action would blow up instead of being reclassified.
 * Reclassification is the correct behaviour — the locators changed.
 *
 * `repair_provenance` is stripped for the same reason (#114). The schema and
 * ADR-0009 both say it is "present only on a row written by a repair rewrite",
 * and carrying it forward on a later plain `PASS` breaks that: the version is
 * labelled with a repair that did not write it, and its `repaired_at` no longer
 * matches that version's `last_verified_at`. Only the repair branch below puts
 * it back, so the invariant is structural rather than something each branch has
 * to remember to clear.
