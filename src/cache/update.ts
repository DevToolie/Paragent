/**
 * The cache-update path the runner drives (issue #64).
 *
 * `ReplayRunner` reports each step's outcome; this turns that into the next
 * version of the corresponding cache row and writes it **through
 * `writeCacheRow()`**, so a rewritten row passes the same fail-closed privacy
 * checks a first write does. A repaired action can carry a locator the original
 * never had, which makes a rewrite exactly as capable of leaking tenant
 * material as an initial write.
 *
 * ## Direction of dependency
 *
 * The runner does not import this file. It takes an optional
 * `onStepOutcome` callback whose shape is declared structurally in
 * `src/runner/types.ts`, and the cache supplies an implementation. Runner →
 * cache would be backwards: the cache is written *to*.
 *
 * It is also **opt-in**. A `ReplayRunner` with no sink behaves exactly as it did
 * before #64, which is what keeps the gate matrix unaffected: no gate run starts
 * consulting or mutating a cache because this landed.
