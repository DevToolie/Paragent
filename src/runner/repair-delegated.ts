/**
 * The repair client that owns no API key (issue #189).
 *
 * `AnthropicRepairModelClient` (#27) makes Paragent buy its own inference. That
 * imposes a shape the thesis does not require: the pitch is giving an agent
 * *that already exists* the ability to drive a browser without paying full
 * reasoning cost every run — and such an agent already has model access. Making
 * it provision a second credential means the user pays twice and manages a key
 * they did not need. With `npx paragent` as the advertised Quick Start, that is
 * the difference between "works out of the box" and "works after you provision
 * a key".
 *
 * So: this client does not call a model. `propose()` hands the **caller** the
 * authorized repair request and takes back a proposal. The host does the
 * reasoning on its own budget.
 *
 * ## A callback, not a protocol
 *
 * An injected async function is the smallest thing that works, and it is the
 * primitive an MCP tool would wrap rather than replace. The transport question
 * (#189, design question 1) is therefore deferred, not answered — no wire
 * format is frozen here.
 *
 * ## The egress boundary is unchanged
 *
 * The handler receives `serializeRepairContext()`'s output and nothing else
 * (ADR-0012, #125). Delegation makes that boundary *more* important, not less:
 * the host is a third party the same way the Anthropic API is, and the
 * `RepairContext` this module never touches carries `params` — the runtime
 * bindings, secrets included. There is no second serializer, which is what
 * `tests/canary/repair-egress.test.ts` is merge-blocking on.
 *
 * ## Tokens are not observable here, and are never estimated
 *
 * The host pays, and a host does not report per-call usage back to a library.
 * So `tokens_in` / `tokens_out` are `0` with `cost_measured: false` — a flag,
 * not a comment, because a zero that means "unmeasured" and a zero that means
 * "no inference ran" are indistinguishable in a `Cost`. Folded into §9 as zeros
 * they would deflate `mean(cost_repair)` and manufacture a *passing* kill-line
 * ratio, which is the most damaging error this project can make (#189
 * constraint 1, CONTRIBUTING rule 3). `ADR-0020` carries the field and the
 * exclusion; `repairCostVsFresh()` and `amortizedTokensOverN()` enforce it.
 *
 * **This does not unblock #39.** A measured denominator still needs a real
 * `usage` block, which is exactly what a delegated client cannot produce.
