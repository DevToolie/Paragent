/**
 * `compiled_trajectory` bundle → `CompiledProgram`.
 *
 * This adapter used to live inside `tests/integration/pipeline.test.ts`, whose
 * comment said it was local "on purpose: the runtime never needs it today".
 * Issue #62 is the day that stopped being true — the live matrix driver replays
 * a committed bundle from `artifacts/compiled/`, so something in `src/` has to
 * turn one into the shape `ReplayRunner` accepts. Keeping a second copy in the
 * experiment directory would mean the tested adapter and the one the gate
 * actually runs could drift.
 *
 * **This is a mapping, not a schema change.** No field is invented on either
 * contract: `CacheRow` already carries `step_index`, `row_id`, `compiled_action`
 * and `assertion`, which is exactly `CompiledStep`. The bundle's own fields
 * (`confidence`, `pool_eligible`, `last_verified_at`, …) are cache bookkeeping
 * the runner has no use for and are deliberately dropped rather than smuggled
 * through.
 *
 * The one value that is **synthesized** is `program_id`, because no contract
 * defines one. `prog-<source_trajectory_id>` is a naming convention, not a
 * contract, and it is the same convention the integration test has used since
 * #52. `docs/gate/runner.md` tracks whether bundle `$id` should become a
 * first-class contract; until that is answered, this stays a convention with a
 * name that says where it came from.
