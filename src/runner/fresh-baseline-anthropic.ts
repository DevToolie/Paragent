/**
 * The real fresh-baseline client (issue #39) — a model driving the browser
 * with no compiled trajectory, turn by turn, until it declares the task done.
 *
 * ## Same SDK wiring and accounting as the repair client, on purpose
 *
 * §9's kill line is `mean(cost_repair) >= 70% * mean(cost_fresh)`. If the two
 * measurements accounted for tokens differently, the ratio would compare two
 * different things wearing the same units. So this module copies
 * `src/runner/repair-anthropic.ts`'s decisions rather than re-deriving them:
 *
 * | Decision | Same as repair client |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `billedInputTokens()` | **Imported, not re-implemented.** Sums `input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens` |
 * | Prompt caching | Off. No `cache_control` on any block |
 * | Retries | None. A turn that throws ends the attempt; tokens already billed on prior turns are kept, never guessed at for the failed one |
 * | Server-side `fallbacks` | Not sent — the model that was billed must be the model `model_id` names |
 * | `temperature` / `top_p` / `top_k` | Not sent — 400s on this model |
 * | Output shape | Structured output (`output_config.format: json_schema`), not tool-use function-calling and not prose parsing |
 * | Construction without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Throws (`MissingFreshBaselineKeyError`) rather than degrading to the stub |
 *
 * One call per **turn**, not one call for the whole task: the model reports
 * exactly one action (or "done") each time, mirroring the single-decision shape
 * `AnthropicRepairModelClient.propose()` already uses. Tokens are summed across
 * every turn in the attempt — the measured cost is the whole task, not one
 * decision.
 *
 * ## What the model is allowed to see
 *
 * `capturePageState(page, "interactive")` — the exact function and the exact
 * context level `AnthropicRepairModelClient` receives via
 * `serializeRepairContext()`. Role + accessible name of interactive elements,
 * landmark roles, URL, title. No raw HTML, no input values, no cookies, no
 * storage (ADR-0012). A fresh agent is not shown more of the page than a repair
 * already is; it is shown it for longer, across a whole task instead of one
 * failed step.
 *
 * ## What the model is never told
 *
 * The compiled program: no locator, no assertion, no step list, no site-key or
 * task-key it could use to look one up. Only `task_goal` — prose describing the
 * outcome — and the live page. See `docs/gate/fresh-baseline.md` for why that
 * boundary is the entire measurement.
