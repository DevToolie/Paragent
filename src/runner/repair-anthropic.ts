/**
 * The real repair model client (issue #27).
 *
 * `StubRepairModelClient` returns `corrected_action: null` and zero tokens, so
 * self-heal rate is structurally 0 and `cost_repair` is structurally zero. That
 * blocks two PRD §9 metrics outright — self-heal success rate, and mean repair
 * cost against fresh-reasoning cost, where the kill line is a ratio.
 *
 * ## What this client may see
 *
 * Only `serializeRepairContext()`'s output (ADR-0012, #125). This module never
 * touches `RepairContext` directly, which is the point: that object carries
 * `params` — the runtime bindings, secrets included — and a client trusted to
 * pick the safe fields itself is a convention, not a boundary.
 * `tests/canary/repair-egress.test.ts` is merge-blocking on exactly that.
 *
 * ## Opt-in, and loud when misconfigured
 *
 * The stub stays the default. This client is constructed explicitly, and throws
 * at construction when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset rather than degrading to a
 * no-op — a gate run that silently used the stub would produce a wrong number
 * that looks real, which is worse than a run that failed.
 *
 * ## Token accounting is the reason the issue exists
 *
 * `cost_repair` is compared against `cost_fresh` at a 70% kill line, so an
 * undercount moves a verdict. **Prompt caching is deliberately not used.**
 * `cache_read_input_tokens` and `cache_creation_input_tokens` are billed
 * differently from plain input tokens, and a repair cost that quietly excluded
 * cache-write tokens would understate against that line. The fields are read and
 * surfaced anyway — if a future change enables caching, the numbers are already
 * being carried rather than discovered missing later.
 *
 * ## No server-side `fallbacks`
 *
 * Deliberate, not an omission. A fallback would let a different model serve the
 * repair while `model_id` is doing reproducibility work for `cost_repair` — the
 * recorded model would no longer be the one that was billed. A refusal is
 * reported as a refusal instead.
