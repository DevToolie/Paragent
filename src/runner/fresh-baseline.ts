/**
 * The fresh-reasoning baseline client (issue #39) — the §9 kill-line's
 * denominator: what it costs a model to do the gate task **from scratch**,
 * with no compiled trajectory, no cached locators, and no step list.
 *
 * ## What "fresh" means
 *
 * See [`docs/gate/fresh-baseline.md`](../../docs/gate/fresh-baseline.md) for the
 * full definition — write it there before reading a number off this code. In
 * one line: a model is handed the task's stated goal and the live page, and
 * must drive the browser to the same outcome the compiled program encodes,
 * having never seen that program's steps, locators, or assertions.
 *
 * ## Symmetry with the repair client
 *
 * §9 compares `cost_repair` against `cost_fresh` at a 70% kill line, so the two
 * measurements must be produced the same way or the ratio is meaningless. This
 * module is deliberately shaped like `src/runner/repair.ts`:
 *
 * - `FreshBaselineClient` is the same kind of seam `RepairModelClient` is — an
 *   interface the runner depends on, injected in tests, real only when a caller
 *   opts in.
 * - `StubFreshBaselineClient` mirrors `StubRepairModelClient`: it reports
 *   `task_success: false` and zero tokens, so a run that never wired a real
 *   client cannot be mistaken for a measurement.
 * - The real implementation, `AnthropicFreshBaselineClient`
 *   (`fresh-baseline-anthropic.ts`), reuses `billedInputTokens` from
 *   `repair-anthropic.ts` verbatim rather than re-deriving it — the accounting
 *   convention has to be identical, not merely similar.

 * would defeat the measurement's whole point (ADR-0006's task is API-reachable
