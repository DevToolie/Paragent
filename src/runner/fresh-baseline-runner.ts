/**
 * FreshBaselineRunner — one measured fresh-reasoning attempt (issue #39).
 *
 * Mirrors `ReplayRunner`'s posture at the scale of one run: measure wall clock
 * around the client call, never invent a token count, emit through the same
 * `MetricsEmitter`.
 *
 * ## Why this does not emit into the gate matrix's own NDJSON
 *
 * A `RunMetric` row has fields — `steps_total`, `repair_count`,
 * `success_with_le_2_repairs`, `cost_replay`, `cost_repair` — that describe a
 * *compiled-program replay*. A fresh attempt has none of those; it is not a
 * replay of anything. This runner still emits a schema-valid `RunMetric` row
 * (every required field present, every zero an honest zero — no compiled
 * steps ran, no repair happened), because the caller was told to use the same
 * `MetricsEmitter` and the schema has no other row shape available. But that
 * row must **never** be appended to the same NDJSON `gate:matrix` writes:
 * `repairCostVsFresh()` and `taskSuccessLe2Repairs()` in `src/metrics/aggregate.ts`
 * pool every run row in the file they are given, unconditionally. A
 * fresh-baseline row mixed into that pool would count as a zero-repair,
 * zero-step "run" and silently dilute the real matrix's success rate and
 * repair-cost mean.
 *
 * The entry point (`experiments/gate-v1/fresh-baseline.ts`) writes these rows
 * to their own file (`out/fresh-baseline/metrics.ndjson`) for exactly this
 * reason. What actually attaches a measured baseline to the matrix's own run
 * rows is `costFresh` on `ReplayRunnerOptions` — a separate, existing
 * mechanism (`src/runner/replay.ts`) that this runner's caller feeds from the
 * *aggregate* of these attempts, never from the rows themselves. See
 * `docs/gate/fresh-baseline.md`.
