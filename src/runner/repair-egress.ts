/**
 * The one thing a repair client may send (ADR-0012, issue #125).
 *
 * `RepairContext` is an in-process object. It holds the frozen assertion, the
 * compiled step, the page snapshot — and `params`, which is
 * `Record<string, string | number | boolean>`: the runtime bindings, including
 * whatever a caller named like a secret. Handing that object to a model client
 * and trusting each client to send only the safe parts is not a boundary, it is
 * a convention.
 *
 * #27 will wire a real Anthropic client. When it does, the repair prompt becomes
 * a **new egress path** — the first one in this codebase that sends page-derived
 * content to a third party — and today nothing asserts what would leave. This
 * module is that assertion: `serializeRepairContext()` is the only authorized
 * shape, it is built by naming fields rather than by removing them, and
 * `tests/canary/repair-egress.test.ts` is merge-blocking.
 *
 * ## Allowlist, not denylist
 *
 * Every field below is written out explicitly. Nothing is spread, nothing is
 * deleted from a copy. A denylist would let a field added to `RepairContext`
 * next year ride out by default; this way a new field is invisible to the model
 * until someone adds a line here, and adding that line is a diff a reviewer
 * sees.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately excluded
 *
 * | Excluded | Why |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `params` | The runtime bindings. Values a caller supplied, including secrets. Never leaves. |
 * | `assertion.expected.template` | Carries typed holes *and*, if a compiler bug ever let one through, a literal |
 * | `step.compiled_action.param_refs` | Names of the caller's slots. Structure, but no reason for the model to need it |
 * | `error_message` | Playwright text that can quote page content and, on a `fill`, the value it tried |
 *
 * `error_message` is the one worth pausing on: it reads like diagnostics, and it
 * is the field a well-meaning change would add first. A Playwright locator error
 * can include the resolved selector and surrounding text, so it is page content
 * arriving through a channel nobody classified.
